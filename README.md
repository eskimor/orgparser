Org-mode parser written in D
======

This is currently a work in progress implementation of an
[org-mode](http://orgmode.org) parser written in the D programming
language.

The intention is to make it easy from D to add new headings,
manipulate TODO states, tags, clock times, properties, ... or do some
restructuring. So a frontend for org-mode files can easily be created
which does not depend on emacs. For example a web based one by using <http://vibed.org>.

Current state: I just started it, nothing works, API is neither complete nor stable.
